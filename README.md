## How to use Hoobot

Hoobot has been programmed with Typescript on top of Node. So the requirements are node version manager (nvm), node package manager (npm) and at least Node version 18.17.0.

## Installation

### Step 1: Download Hoobot

Begin by acquiring the latest version of Hoobot. Ensure the download is from a reputable source to avoid any security risks. Look for the file named `hoobot-latest.zip`.

### Step 2: Extract Hoobot

Once downloaded, locate the `hoobot-latest.zip` file and extract its contents. You can choose any preferred location on your device to store the Hoobot files. This location will be your working directory for Hoobot operations.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Dependencies are essential components that Hoobot needs to function correctly. Follow these steps tailored to your operating system:

1. **Windows Users:**

   - Navigate to the Hoobot folder in your terminal.
   - Execute the `windows.bat` file by typing `windows.bat` and pressing Enter.

2. **macOS Users:**

   - Open the terminal and change your directory to the Hoobot folder.
   - Run the command `sh osx.sh` to install the necessary dependencies.

3. **Linux Users:**
   - In the terminal, navigate to the Hoobot folder.
   - Type `sh linux.sh` and press Enter to begin the dependency installation process.

### Configuration Files

#### `settings/hoobot-options.json`

Configuring Hoobot is a critical step to tailor its functionality to your trading preferences and security requirements.

Hoobot uses a JSON file named `hoobot-options.json` for its configuration settings. Initially, this file is named `hoobot-options.json.example` and needs to be renamed and edited. It has example configuration for running the bot.

- Locate `settings/hoobot-options.json.example` in the Hoobot folder.
- Rename this file to `hoobot-options.json`.

This file contains the settings for live trading. It includes configurations for exchanges, trading strategies, and various other options.
There is also `settigns/hoobot-options-simulation.json.example` which used for simulation. Simulation requires Binance api keys as it uses historical data from Binance.

#### `settings/hoobot-options-simulate.json`

This file is similar to `settings/hoobot-options.json` but is used for simulation mode. The simulation mode mimics trading without actual transactions, and it is only supported for Binance. This allows users to test strategies without risking real funds.

### Simulation Mode

To enable simulation mode, set the `simulate` parameter to `true` in the `.env` file or run `npm run simualte`. The bot will then use the settings from `settings/hoobot-options-simulate.json`.

Ensure that your `settings/hoobot-options-simulate.json` includes the same structure as `settings/hoobot-options.json` but tailored for simulation. Specifically, verify that the exchange name is set to "Binance" and configure the necessary parameters accordingly. Currently only `algorithmic` mode is supported in simulation.

### Starting Hoobot

With your configurations set, it's time to launch Hoobot:

- Open a terminal and navigate to the Hoobot directory.
- Execute the command `npm run start` to initialize Hoobot.
- Hoobot will be ran with PM2 Node process manager to keep it up and running in case of unknown crashes.

To run the simulation:

- Open a terminal and navigate to the Hoobot directory.
- Execute the command `npm run simulate` to initialize Hoobot simulation.
- Remember that the simulaton works with only with Binance data and growingMax.buy must be set for starting balance.

### Shutdown Hoobot

With your Hoobot running and you want to change settings and reboot it or stop running it:

- Open a terminal and navigate to the Hoobot directory.
- Execute the command `npm run stop` to stop Hoobot from being run on PM2.

When rebooting, you can now run `npm run start` again.

### Updating Hoobot

You can update Hoobot by running `windows.bat`, `linux.sh`, `osx.sh` again in the hoobot folder. It will check that dependancies exist and downloads always latest Hoobot for you.

**Note:** Ensure that any symbols you intend to trade with have been actively traded (at least two trades) before employing Hoobot. Be cautious that certain exchanges like Xeggex and NonKYC may experience instability.

Through this guide, you're now equipped to install and configure Hoobot with precision. Enjoy your trading journey, knowing that Hoobot is configured to your exact specifications.

### force.json

Force.json is a file where you can force allow negative trade for one trade as in force skip holding until positive trade. For example if your bot sells too quickly and it needs to buy with negative trade. Then you can flip the switch in the json for the symbol. The skip value will be automatically changed back to false after the negative trade.

```
{
  "BNBUSDT": {
    "skip": true
  },
  "ETHTUSD": {
    "skip": false
  }
}
```

### Simulation

You can run simulations with command `npm run simulate`, simulations currently support symbols available from Binance and you can adjust simulation configuration from file `hoobot-options-simulate.json`. The simulate file has same format as `hoobot-options.json` but exists only to seperate simulation options from Hoobot live options.

At the end of simulation you get results like this:

```
{
    "Starting balance": "20.00",
    "Final Balance": "2870.05",
    "ROI": "142.50",
    "BTC/USDT trades": 4037,
    "BTC/USDT stop losses": 96,
    "BTC/USDT take profits": 246,
    "BTC/USDT sells": 1745,
    "BTC/USDT buys": 1949
}

```
